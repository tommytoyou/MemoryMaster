### Credits
I was inspired by a training that memory experts practice, and I do from time to time to help me improve my memory through practice. I do not know the code I will use at this time, but I have seen some interesting ways to set the basis for a deck of cards and how to shuffle and maniputlte them on YouTube and will give credit for what inspiration I gearner from them and other sources.

Give credit to any `codepen` that inspired you, `medium` article that helped you, or `stackoverflow` that pointed you in the right direction.

### Future development
Initially it will be a simplistic memory match. I will build on this over time with adding speed choices for the memory flip of the deck and times to beat with personal bests listed as well as a choice of background music and a website and app for the same(most likely included with a gaggle of other training exercises on www.p3plabs.com)
